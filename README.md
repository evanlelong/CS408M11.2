Honestly for this project I used alot of AI. Not because I couldnt do this by myself I just wanted to see its solution.
It was able to help me with creating the load table function and more of that. I have done a lot of intergrating apis within frontend frameworks so this was nothing new to me.
The css was pretty simple though and not that complicated. The most AI did was help with the load table function so that way we can call it after adding and deleting an item.

A simple bulleted list below is sufficient. For example:

- copilot :)
